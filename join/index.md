Our lab studies the neural basis of decision making in humans and macaques. If you are a student and you are interested in doing a research project in the lab, please contact me via [email](mailto:d.jeurissen@columbia.edu) to talk about the possibility of joining our lab. Please include your curriculum vitae and a description of the type of project you would be interested in. You can also apply if you have no prior research experience. Some example projects are listed below.

#### Behavioral studies
Experiments in our lab include behavioral experiments with healthy human participants and patients with Alzheimer's disease. Most behavioral experiments use a computer task to test how subjects make decisions. A student project could consist of developing a new task and collecting and analyzing data.

#### Electrophysiology
We record data from neurons in parietal cortex to study the neural basis of decision making. A student project could include analyzing a data set to answer questions about the response profile of neurons.

#### Causal manipulations
We use optogenetics, chemogenetics, and pharmacology to manipulate neural activity in cortical areas and examine the effect on behavior and neural responses in distant brain areas. A student working on this project could analyze the behavior in perceptual decision tasks, eye movement data, and electrophysiology data.
