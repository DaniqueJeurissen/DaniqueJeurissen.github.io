I am a postdoctoral fellow in the [Shadlen lab](https://shadlenlab.columbia.edu) at Columbia University in New York.

In September 2024 I will start the [Jeurissen lab](https://www.jeurissenlab.com/) at the [Center for Neural Science](https://cas.nyu.edu/academic-programs/bulletin/departments-and-programs/center-for-neural-science.html) at [New York University](https://cas.nyu.edu/).

My research is supported by the [Simons Collaboration on the Global Brain](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/life-sciences/simons-collaboration-global-brain/). I study the neural basis of high-cognitive functions. I combine behavioral studies in non-human primates with single-unit recordings, high-channel electrophysiology, optogenetics, chemogenetics, and pharmacology. Before I moved to Columbia, I was a PhD-student in the [Roelfsema lab](https://nin.nl/research/researchgroups/roelfsema-group/) at the [Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience](https://nin.nl/) in Amsterdam and studied object perception.
