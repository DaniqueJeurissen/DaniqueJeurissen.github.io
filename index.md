I am a postdoctoral fellow in the [Shadlen lab](https://shadlenlab.columbia.edu) at Columbia University in New York. We collaborate with the [Tsao lab](http://tsaolab.caltech.edu) at Caltech. My research is supported by the [Simons Collaboration on the Global Brain](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/life-sciences/simons-collaboration-global-brain/). I study the neural basis of decision making. I combine behavioral studies in non-human primates with single-unit recordings, high-channel electrophysiology, optogenetics, chemogenetics, and pharmacology. Before I moved to Columbia, I was a PhD-student in the [Roelfsema lab](http://herseninstituut.nl/en/research/researchgroups/roelfsema-group/) at the [Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience](http://www.herseninstituut.nl/en/) in Amsterdam and studied object perception.
